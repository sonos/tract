# Unreleased
* [Breaking] Small API changes in model api: .compact(), .optimize(), .declutter() now take &mut self and work in place.
* [LICENSE] Only the licensing for dependencies of the top-level library crates (tensorflow, onnx, kaldi, pulse) will now be monitored. The command line tool (tract crate in cli folder) is for developpers (tract developpers or tract integrators), is not meant to be shipped to end-user, and it concentrates most of the license and dependency complexity.

## 0.12.1 - 2020-12-11

* 0.12.0 is a misfire.

* API BREAKING: TypedFact::dt_shape & friends can not fail anymore, no longer return a result (remove `?`)

* switch from error_chain to anyhow
* simplify trivial gathers to a slice
* generalize symbolic dimension a bit: support "2S" and the like
* deprecate "x" syntax in CLI, please use `,`  instead

## 0.11.0

### Breaking 

* NNEF: tract-nnef no longer performs gunziping, but expect an uncompressed tar
    stream. We found out is it counter-productive (weights matrices are more or
    less random, they do not compress easily, and decompression is expensive).
    NNEF networks in the wild are .tgz file. Using flate2, decompression is a
    one-liner, but it must be done by the client code now.
* bumped extended nnef compat version (unchecked at this stage) to "alpha1"
* move pulse operators and translation to their own crate and nnef registry
* generalize TDim to support an arbitrary number of symbols
* concretize_stream_dim is superseded by concrentize_dims

### Notable

* new crates, building on tract-opl introduction:
    * *tract-pulse-opl*: pulse runtime (handful of ops, including Delay) is now separated from core
    * *tract-onnx-opl*: onnx runtime (4 ops not belonging in core)
    * *tract-pulse*: pulsification of models (model-translation time)
    * tract-onnx is now limited to onnx model loading and conversion

## 0.10.10 - 2020-08-30

* load a NNEF as a TypedModel using tract_nnef, and from the CLI
* dump a tract TypedModel to NNEF (with extensions for op not nnef compatbile)
* not a full coverage of nnef, but enough for most CNN (image categorizers zoo working)
* 80% of onnx tests are surviving a NNEF dump and reload at this stage

## 0.10.0 - 2020-07-28

### ONNX

* covered operators compatible with Operator Sets 9, 10, 11 (new) and 12 (new)

### API Breaking

* Tensor::l1 method is gone

### Windows

* Support for -gnu targets (non-mvsc).

### Notable

* --cost now gives the number of parameters in the model
* SimpleState is clonable again (actually useful !)

## 0.9.2 - 2020-06-16

* introduce `TypedModel::method.concretize_stream_dim`
* various pulsification bugfixes

## 0.9.1 - 2020-06-16

* fix Reshape with TDim

## 0.9.0 - 2020-06-15

Still no shortage of version numbers...

### API Breakage

* NormalizedModel (and friends) are gone. They were only useful as a pre-pulse transformation pre-requisite that the current TypedModel (& co) meets.
* TypedModel::into_optimized() is gone. InferenceModel::into_optimized() stays as an end-to-end shortcut for simple cases. It does .into_typed()?.declutter()?.optimize()).
* TypedModel::codegen() is now ::optimize()

## 0.8.0 - 2020-06-13

I wish I had seen these issues yesterday. Anyway, version numbers are cheap.

* Bumping minimum rust to 1.41

## 0.7.0 - 2020-06-12

* CLI refactoring (hopefully stabilizing a bit?)
    * `profile --bench` is now bench
    * profile is now `dump --profile`
    * cost is now `dump --cost`
    * profiling is now done during a full net instead of per op
    * new "compact" graph dumper, profile visual hints
    * `dump --cost --profile --json` output profiling and cost information
    * show logical names for ops instead of the Op struct names (not 100% sure it's right)
    * criterion integration
* WASM support for tract-onnx and tract-tensorflow targets (CI)
* Convenience methods added to Models to allow model building in fluent style, up to Plan instantiation (SimplePlan now nicknamed RunnableModel). Non breaking.
* Support for ONNX bidi LSTM (CI), GRU and RNN (untested, consider alpha)
* Fixes around nets with a non trivial batch size (axis simplification code, matmul op fusion)

## 0.6.3 - 2020-04-25

* Lock ndarray version to dodge rustc/llvm issue (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/71506)

## 0.6.2 - 2020-04-15

* ARMv8 tanh / sigmoid optimisation

### API Breaking

* refactor exports and dependencies
    * preferred way to use tract is now to `use tract_tensorflow::prelude::*;`
    * singleton framework is built by `let tensorflow = tensorflow()`. The Framework trait is in the prelude too.
    * the prelude contains a reexport of `tract_core`, and of ndarray as `tract_ndarray`
    * no more need to declare dependency on `tract-core` and/or `tract-linalg` in Cargo.toml
    * same goes for `tract_onnx`

* Cost now reports Delay ops buffer size
* Bump dependencies (protobuf) and fix codegen
* Windows CI now performs a top-level "cargo check"

## 0.5.1 - 2019-09-24

### Bugfix

* remove the no_panic checks, as too fragile (breaking non-lto builds)

## 0.5.0 - 2019-09-20

### Breaking

* Change tensor facts names for consistency: TensorFact is now InferenceFact.

### Notable

* Introduce Windows support, including CI coverage for linalg
* Switch from Travis to GitHub Actions
* Internal refactoring around tract-core canonic opset

This Changelog started way too late. But better late than never.
